            <h2>The History of Care Packages</h2>
            <p>
                Care packages started in post-World War II Europe, where these packages that supply 
                essential things to survive were sent to soldiers and others far from home. These 
                packages were first sent by CARE or Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe. 
                Families relied on CARE packages that consist of mainly dry food items that were sent 
                every four months to fill their stomachs. The CARE packages are a symbol of American 
                generosity as a means of diplomacy to rekindle their relationship with Europe and as 
                a mission to help people in need. According to CARE's president, Michelle Nunn. "The 
                idea that you could send support to strangers on the other side of the world — that 
                was a novel idea." 
                <br>
                <br>
                The care packages were first packed with essential food such as rice, beans, powdered 
                eggs and milk. Later on, they have adjusted to Asian palette ingredients and kosher 
                foods that was sent out to Jewish refugees. Today, CARE has expanded to Northern 
                Europe, Asia, and Africa. 
                <br>
                <br>
                CARE has now switched over from boxes to electronic banking systems as donations. 
                They provide families with a debit card to be able to buy what they need in their 
                circumstances. This also helps in saving costs in transportation as well as helping 
                their local business and farmers. Currently, CARE is focused on ending child malnutrition.

            <h2>CARE’s Gifts with Lasting Change</h2>
            <p>
                A gift with a lasting change is a gift that empowers everyone around the world. These 
                are gifts that you can share joy and is well appreciated when received. A gift that 
                makes a lasting change is a great way to recognize friends or loved ones on whatever 
                occasions. CARE is an organization that helps create solutions to poverty around the 
                world. CARE’s goal is to provide perfect gift options for various interests or budgets 
                in return it helps fund CARE in helping people around the world in 94 countries.
            </p>
            <h2>Surveys on American’s Love for Care Packages</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the surveys done by CARE, 92 percent of Americans wish to receive a care package 
                and 98 percent wish to send one. This indicates that Americans still have the nature of 
                helping someone in need whether they are their family, friends or refugees around the 
                world according to CARE’s CEO, Michelle Nunn. The world now is experiencing a humanitarian 
                crisis from conflicts in Syria and Yemen, hunger in Ethiopia, Somalia and other African 
                countries. In the survey, 76 percent of Americans interpret the meaning of “care package” 
                as “basic necessities for someone in need” and 58 percent interpret it as “something that 
                shows you care”. In addition, Millenials or people ages 18-34 said they would most likely 
                send care packages to a refugee.  This means that working people of today would take an 
                effort to spend their time and efforts to contribute to causes such as sending out care 
                packages or other help to people in need around the world.
