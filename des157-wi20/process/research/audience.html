                What I got from the SWOT Analysis is that I should keep the features of my final project
                simple. Since there are other methods of communication out there where people can find friends
                from around the world such as social media, I have to create a project that does not act as 
                social media but it can help connect people in a matching system. Another idea I gathered is that
                I should make project simple at the same time easy to create with the limited skills I have at 
                coding. I can possibly create a narrative simulation where people are put in a situation where
                they get connected to some from another part of the world. They share different things about their
                culture and just their everyday life that they have a lot in common about. Then they find more information
                about their friend's culture and social issues. At the end of the narrative, they both send each other
                a care package, that includes products from their own countries, it could be food or small tokens.
                This could be a way to pitch idea to make people be aware that we can be global citizens that should 
                make efforts to get to know each other and break boundaries. This can also be an idea to start encouraging
                people that have the resources and skills to create the platform idea.
