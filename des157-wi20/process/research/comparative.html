            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                This website allows users from different countries to connect with each other
                with the purpose of just making new friends or maybe learning more about each 
                others cultures and practicing with native speakers when they are learning a
                certain language. It is source to find easy contacts as it asks for the users 
                basic information such as name, country and email address, this allows users to
                communicate through email outside the site. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This medium can be used to affect change because it is a virtual platform for people
                around the world to connect with anyone from around the world without traveling
                overseas. It makes people make new friends, practice learning a new language with someone
                or just simply get them informed from an actual person from a country about their culture,
                customs. It makes the world a little bit more connected and reduces division and unawareness.
                <br>
                <br>
                Think about the kinds of changes you would like your project, 
                or digital product to affect in its users, or the world at large.
                The kind of changes that I would like for my project for users is to make a space where
                everyone can get connected and little bit less divided. It is a great way for people to get
                informed of what is happening outside their country and maybe it will reduce discrimination
                and misinformation in perceptions about different countries.
            </p>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>
                1. Collecting information from users (forms) - I think it is effective in a way where it asks for people's 
                basic information for security reasons. It only asks for country, age, gender and email. Some things that 
                could be improved on is the UI of the overall website and the layout of the display of the users' profile.
                If information is well with an option to put basic information, it will allow people to select better people
                they have a lot in common with rather than selecting random strangers.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Limiting content and presenting it in a deliberate way to users - Overall the website is pretty simple to follow
                with limited menu optionns that are relevent such as home, about and search members. The website is pretty organized 
                for people to not get confused. What can be better is that the information display can be improved and updated to a 
                more modern style and making profile selections easier to view. 
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Providing choices to let users prioritize their own pathways 
                through content, or actions within the digital product (i.e. navigation). - In the search members page users have the
                option to choose which profiles they can view, such as gender, age, recent or old members. I think this is good that 
                they can be able to have a choice to limit and keep their search more focused. What could be better is that it could 
                use more fun selections such as things they have in common which can also be added on the the type of information
                they can put in when they log in. 
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Provide clues to functionality and orient users to how elements of 
                the interface function (i.e. motion in UI). - I think it has a relatively simple interface which makes it intuitively 
                easy to use. It has clearly labeled navigation bars which does exactly it says. It needs improvement on the design and 
                by eliminating a lot of distracting elements such as the banner on top of the home page. I feel that if information is 
                layed out better, information will be a lot more easier to understand and see by users. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What is the emotional impact of these projects? and to what degree is that appropriate or effective for the product you are reviewing?
                <br>
                <br>
                The emotional impact of these project is that it allows people to feel connected with people around the world and make them a little
                less lonely and feel more involved. To a degree this is what the purpose of what having a penpal is which is why this site still exists. It's 
                because people are longing for connection with people from different countries.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                It is interactive and engaging for users in a way that people can do so much in just one to be able to offer help and support.
                It offers a request a Care Package where they have an option to select and send care packages to their loved ones or people in need.
                It also has a Cards tab where they can have personalized cards to send. A donation tab where they can directly send money for support.
                It has a volunteer option where people can check for opportunities to get active in their community. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It has a lot of uses to be able to affect change. It has a list of options where people can provide support for those in need. It helps
                people who are willing to help to have a resource to be able to make an impact easily by just compiling different services they can do 
                via an app. It makes it a lot easier for both the people that are seeking help and people that are willing to help.
                <br>
                <br>
                Think about the kinds of changes you would like your project, or digital product to affect in its users, or the world at large.
                The changes I would like my project to affect is for people around the world can have a platform for impact. There are websites that provides
                donations and signatures for certain causes but why not open up a centralized system that is also accessible globally. Not only can people become
                penpals with people around the world, they can also provide support to their friends abroad.
            </p>
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>
                1. Collecting information from users (forms) - It allows people to enter their information in certain functions such as when they are sending cards
                or donations. Simple informations such as their email and banking information which helps with security and privacy issues. They don't really ask 
                people to enter and create an account which could be problematic because they may needs some updates about the status of their care package being
                sent and where their donations are going to. It also does not connect them to the people where their causes go towards to.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Limiting content and presenting it in a deliberate way to users - It does a good job in minimizing texts and instead makes use of tabs, icons and
                tiles to create selections. Making it visual makes it more interesting and interactive to users. It needs improvements on the layout of menu options.
                I think there is a better way of simplifying it and making it easier for people to see and understand what they mean.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Providing choices to let users prioritize their own pathways 
                through content, or actions within the digital product (i.e. navigation). - The app provides the users choices on how they can participate in making an 
                impact such as giving out cards, care packages, donations, volunteering, giving out a prayer, or sharing in social media. This gives the users the option
                and choices on what they would like to do and it creates a collection of where it has everything they can possibly search for in offereing support. I think 
                it can be improved by simplifying the pathways of each options. Instead of its selections keep sending all information a website in their browser, it can 
                just be simplified by just having everything in one app and minimizing web page transfers through a connection of option menus. 
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Provide clues to functionality and orient users to how elements of 
                the interface function (i.e. motion in UI). - It takes advantage of good icons which makes it easy for users to understand the functionality of menu options.
                I think they did a good job at doing this because it makes a lot of things more intuitive to understand for people by adding icons and visuals. I think it can be 
                improved by lessening the use of some icons because overdoing it can be too distracting in the flow of using the app.
                <br>
                <br>
                What is the emotional impact of these projects? and to what degree is that appropriate or effective for the product you are reviewing? 
                <br>
                <br>
                The emotional impact of this project is really impactful because it offers people the ability to take action by different options they can do. By laying out their
                options, it makes it easier for people to have access the information and services they need than searching for long list of options in google.
