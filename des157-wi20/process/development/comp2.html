                For my second iteration, I refined my overall Care Trade website and focused on really
                thinking of ways I can integrate CSS and Javascript interaction into it. I changed my
                idea of having a full functional website to focusing on doing my homepage since there
                are a lot of interactive elements in the "About us" section. It includes a lot of stuff
                that we learned in class and other interactions that I will learn to add into it as well 
                such as scroll pins and scroll objects appearing. By focusing on the homepage, the users
                will really get to feel what my product does and how it satisfies the objectives of the 
                conference.
