                I thought about creating a simulation web app where they are given a walk through of a given account
                where their profile is already set up and they have a list of friends that they can select to match with.
                It shows them connecting with a friend from Iran because of similarity of interest. They then are taken
                to a simulation where they can chat each other and inform each other about their countries and cultures or
                just about themselves. They are also shown an option to give gifts to their friends where they can enter their
                friend's address and a sweet message that comes along with it.
