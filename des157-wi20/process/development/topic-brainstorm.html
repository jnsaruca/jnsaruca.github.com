                What I got from this brainstorm activity is the constribution of sharing information
                to meet needs in miscommunication and to supply information to educate people around
                the world. I think a good idea is a website where people from around the world can make friends
                from people from a different country. Kind of like a penpal, where they inform each
                other of different information about themselves and their culture. It gives me an
                idea of a messaging website that connects people or an informational website that
                features a program to exchange care packages that includes a little information
                about their culture. As of now, I am still a little bit fuzzy on a final idea but 
                I am leading towards creating better communications.
