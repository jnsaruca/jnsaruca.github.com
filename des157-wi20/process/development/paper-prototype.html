                I created a prototype of a website for a desktop. It has a combination of blog site,
                GofundMe, Etsy for care package products system. When a a user go to the homepage,
                they can see different articles that are either trending or new. In the menu options
                they can choose "Countries" to discover different stories from around the world written
                by people from those countries. In the "themes" menu they can choose which social issue
                the user would like to participate in. The "Contribute" allows the user to be a writer
                themselves and start a fundraising for their story. The "Order" menu shows the care packages
                they have purchased. On the bottom of an article, users can leave a comment to ask questions
                or give ratings as well.
